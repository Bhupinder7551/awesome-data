The World Bank has a wide array of high quality data and much of it is [open data][[]. It includes over 15 major databases with more than 2000 indicators.

[open data]: https://opendefinition.org/

## Data

There are a variety of different databases.

One of the major open ones are the World Development Indicators which provide a variety of important indicators ranging from GDP and population to CO2 emissions and literacy in a standardized cross country form.

## API

The World Bank has a data API. You can use this to access a variety of data including the world developemn

You can get data in CSV, JSON and XML (default).

Per indicator:

```bash
https://api.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS?format=csv

# for some reason json format just yields metadata
https://api.worldbank.org/indicator/GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS?format=json
```

## License: OPEN (mostly)

Currently no easy way to automatedly obtain that listing though.

As of April 20th 2010 data is now open (subject to some reservations for specific datasets). See this [blog post](http://blog.okfn.org/2010/04/20/world-bank-opens-up-development-data/).
